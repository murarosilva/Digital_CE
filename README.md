## Abstract
In the field of sustainability, the circular economy (CE) has emerged as a transformative approach to resource utilization and waste minimization. More recently, digital tools have showed potential to accelerate the transition to more sustainable and circular practices This paper adopts the scientometric methodology that utilized the Leiden Algorithm for clustering publications based on direct citations, to explore the integration of digitalization and artificial intelligence (AI) in the circular economy. We refine this approach by focusing on a narrower dataset that captures the interplay between technological advancements and circular economic practices. By employing a large language model, we generate concise, informative labels for each cluster, thereby enhancing the understanding of cognitive connections within this interdisciplinary field. The study analyzes the evolution of topics over time, assessing how digital tools and AI have influenced the productivity and thematic development of circular economy research. Preliminary results suggest a significant shift towards smart automation and data-driven strategies in resource management, highlighting the pivotal role of AI and digital technologies in advancing CE principles. This analysis not only underscores the dynamic nature of the circular economy but also provides a methodological blueprint for future research in integrating advanced technologies with environmental sustainability efforts.
